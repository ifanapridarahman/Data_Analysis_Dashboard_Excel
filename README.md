## KPI's Requirement

1. **Total Revenue** : The sum of the total price of all pizza orders

3. **Total Pizzas Sold** : The sum of the quantities of all pizzas sold
4. **Total Orders** : The total number of orders placed
5. **Average Pizzas Per Order** : The average number of pizzas sold per order, calculated by dividing the total number of pizzas sold by the total number of orders

## Chart Requirement
I would like to visualize various aspects of our pizza sales data to gain insight and understand key trends. I have identified the following requirements for creating charts.
1. **Daily Trend for Total Orders:** 
Create a bar chart that displays the daily trend of total orders over a specific time period. This chart will help us any patterns of fluctuations in order volumes on a daily basis.
2. **Monthly Trend for Total Orders**
Create a line chart that illustrates the hourly trend of total orders throughout the day. This chart will allow us to identify peak hours or periods of high order activity
3. **Percentage of Sales by Pizza Category**
Create a pie chart that shows the distribution of sales across different pizza categories. This chart will provide insight into the popularity of various pizza categories and their contribution to overall sales
4. **Percentage of Sales by Pizza Size**
Generate a pie chart that represents the percentage of sales attributed to different pizza size. This chart will help us understand customer preferences for pizza size and their impact on sales
5. **Total Pizzas Sold by Pizza Category**
Create a funnel chart that presents the total number of pizzas sold for each pizza category. This chart will allow us to compare the sales performance of different pizza category
6. **Top 5 Best Sellers by Revenue, Total Quantity, and Total Orders**
Create a bar chart highlighting the top 5 best-selling pizzas based on the Revenue, Total Quantity, and Total Orders. This chart help us identify the most popular pizza options.
7. **Bottom 5 Worst Seller by Revenue, Total Quantity, and Total Orders**
Create a bar chart showcasing the bottom t worst-selling pizzas on the Revenue, Total Quantity, and Total Orders. This chart will enable us to identify underperforming or less popular pizza options.
